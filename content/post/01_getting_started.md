The main goal of this blog is to document the process of learning Go by me. I will be implementing a basic ray tracing algorithm, that will be able to render spheres and triangles, and use Lambert and Phong materials.

My ultimate goal here is to learn more about Go and Goroutines. It is possible that this will evolve into a path tracer.

Stay tuned.
